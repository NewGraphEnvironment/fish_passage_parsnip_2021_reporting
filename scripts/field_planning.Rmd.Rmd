conn <- DBI::dbConnect(
  RPostgres::Postgres(),

dbGetQuery(conn,
           "SELECT table_name
           FROM information_schema.tables
           WHERE table_schema='whse_fish'")
# # # # #
# # # # # ##list column names in a table
dbGetQuery(conn,
           "SELECT column_name,data_type
           FROM information_schema.columns
           WHERE table_schema = 'bcfishpass'
           and table_name='streams'")

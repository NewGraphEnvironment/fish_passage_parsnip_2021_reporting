A multi-year plan with one to two structure replacements (or removals) each year with works at each site phased over two years each is recommended.  This approach will facilitate progress at a minimum of one site per year and allows ample time for planning, coordination and funding acquisition related to each restoration. Multi-year planning allows an inclusive environment to solicit funding collaboration with the numerous potential partners and stakeholders in the watershed (i.e. Sinclar, Canfor, CN Rail, Coastal Gas Link, FLNR, fish passage technical working group, Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, McLeod Lake, Treaty 8 Nations, etc.).
 
 * In 2023/2024 we propose replacement of crossings where preparations were made in 2022/2023 in partnership with Sinclar.  Sinclar has committed to obtaining portions of the funding for this work through the forestry appraisal system and we will actively engage with partners and stakeholders to obtain other funding contributions.  Additionally, we propose preparations for structure replacement at an addition two sites that can be completed in the following fiscal.  This model of progress is proposed to continue through 2025/2026 fiscal.
 
 * In 2022/2023  we will work together with BCTS and other interested parties to rehabilitate and monitor the Chuchinka-Colbourne FSR where 125345 (Tributary to Parsnip River) will be removed and the road deactivated/decompacted and planted in 2022.  We will continue to engage with CN to advance remediation of passage at crossing 57687 located under the railway immediately upstream of this site.
 
  * We recommend continuing to engage FWCP partners and stakeholders to explore and clearly communicate fish passage issues in the Parsnip River watershed, build relationships and obtain partnership funding commitments while collaboratively prioritizing, planning and delivering fish passage restorations.
 
 * We recommend continuing to implement capacity building programs that will provide resources and skills for watershed stakeholders and partners to engage in watershed restoration planning activities and on the ground works as well as to monitor outcomes of project initiatives.

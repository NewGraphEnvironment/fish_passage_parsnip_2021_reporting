This project builds on Society for Ecosystem Restoration Northern BC (SERNbc) work in 2019 - 2020 which can be referenced [here](https://newgraphenvironment.github.io/Parsnip_Fish_Passage/) [@irvine2020ParsnipRiver]. In 2019, following a literature review, analysis of fish habitat modelling data, the Provincial Stream Crossing Inventory System (PSCIS) and a community scoping exercise within the McLeod Lake Indian Band habitat confirmation assessments were conducted throughout the Parsnip River watershed. At 17 sites where habitat confirmation assessments were conducted, crossings were rated for fish passage remediation priority. During the habitat confirmations a total of approximately 15 km of stream was assessed with 10 crossings rated as high priorities for rehabilitation, three crossings rated as moderate priorities and four crossings rated as low priorities.

The health and viability of freshwater fish populations can depend on access to tributary and off channel areas which provide refuge during high flows, opportunities for foraging, overwintering habitat, spawning habitat and summer rearing habitat [@Bramblett_2002; @swalesRoleOffChannelPonds1989; @diebel_etal2015EffectsRoad].  Culverts can present barriers to fish migration due to low water depth, increased water velocity, turbulence, a vertical drop at the culvert outlet and/or maintenance issues [@slaneyFishHabitatRehabilitation1997; @cote_etal2005Fishpassage]. As road crossing structures are commonly upgraded or removed there are numerous opportunities to restore connectivity by ensuring that fish passage considerations are incorporated into repair, replacement, relocation and deactivation designs.

SERNbc is working together with the Peace Region Fish and Wildlife Compensation Program (FWCP), the McLeod Lake Indian Band, the Provincial Fish Passage Technical Working Group (FPTWG), road/rail tenure holders and other FWCP stakeholders/partners to prioritize, plan and fund the restoration of fish passage at Parsnip River watershed road crossing structure barriers previously ranked as high or moderate priorities. In 2021/2022 we were able to source funding from the Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development to initiate replacement of a high priority crossing in the Missinka River watershed with a clearspan bridge.  With support from FWCP in 2023 remediation of fish passage at the site will be completed and works at an additional high priority site (Chuchinka-Arctic FSR) will be initiated. Additionally, through the ongoing development of open source analysis and data presentation tools we are identifying and highlighting sites with potential connectivity issues and are planning on the ground works to assess opportunities.  Planning, field assessments and follow up reporting will continue to include engagement with road/rail tenure holders, build awareness for connectivity issues in the wider community and build capacity for ecosystem restoration in the Peace Region.

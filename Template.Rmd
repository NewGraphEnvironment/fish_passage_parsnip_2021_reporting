This project builds on Society for Ecosystem Restoration Northern BC (SERNbc) work in 2019 - 2020 which can be referenced [here](https://newgraphenvironment.github.io/Parsnip_Fish_Passage/). In 2019, following a literature review, analysis of fish habitat modelling data, the Provincial Stream Crossing Inventory System (PSCIS) and a community scoping exercise within the McLeod Lake Indian Band habitat confirmation assessments were conducted throughout the Parsnip River watershed. At 17 sites where habitat confirmation assessments were conducted, crossings were rated for fish passage remediation priority.

<br>

 is working together with the Peace Region Fish and Wildlife Compensation Program (FWCP), the McLeod Lake Indian Band, the Provincial Fish Passage Technical Working Group (FPTWG), road/rail tenure holders and other FWCP stakeholders/partners to prioritize, plan and fund the restoration of fish passage at road crossing structure barriers throughout the Parsnip River watershed. 

<br>


The project aligns with the Fish and Wildlife Compensation Program Streams Action Plan [@fishandwildlifecompensationprogramPeaceBasinStreams2014] objective 1d-1 of reviewing existing information on stream restoration/enhancement opportunities and provide prioritized enhancement recommendations. Additionally, the project aims to conserve and enhance high priority species and habitats by aligning with @fishandwildlifecompensationprogramPeaceBasinStreams2014 objective 1d-3: restoring fish passage in streams.


<!--chapter:end:0100-intro.Rmd-->


# Goal and Objectives {-}

The project engages FWCP partners and stakeholders to clearly communicate fish passage issues in the Parsnip River watershed while collaboratively planning and executing the steps necessary to realize fish passage restorations.

# Study Area {-}

## Tse'khene {-}

The Parsnip River watershed is located within the south-eastern portion of the 108,000 km^2^ traditional territory of the Tse'khene from the [McLeod Lake Indian Band](https://www.mlib.ca/about/History). The Tse'khene *"People of the Rocks"* are a south westerly extension of the Athabascan speaking people of northern Canada.  They were a nomadic hunting people whose language belongs to the Beaver-Sarcee-Tse'khene branch of Athapaskan [@HistoryWhoWeAre].  Extensive work is underway to preserve the language with resources such as First Voices available [online](https://www.firstvoices.com/explore/FV/sections/Data/Athabascan/Tse'Khene%20(McLeod%20Lake)/Tse'Khene%20(McLeod%20Lake)/learn) and in [app form](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tsekhene-mcleod-lake/id1503929250) for iphone and ipad devices [@firstpeopleculturalcouncil2022LearnTse; @firstpeoplesheritagelanguageandculturecouncil2022TseKhene].

<br>

The continental divide separates watersheds flowing north into the Arctic Ocean via the Mackenzie River and south and west into the Pacific Ocean via the Fraser River (Figure \@ref(fig:overview-map)). The Parsnip River is a 6th order stream with a watershed that drains an area of 5597km^2^. The mainstem of the river flows within the Rocky Mountain Trench in a north direction into Williston Reservoir starting from the continental divide adjacent to Arctic Lakes. Major tributaries include the Misinchinka, Colbourne, Reynolds, Anzac, Table, Hominka and Missinka sub-basins which drain the western slopes of the Hart Ranges of the Rocky Mountains.  The Parsnip River has a mean annual discharge of `r round(fasstr::calc_longterm_mean(station_number = "07EE007")$LTMAD,1)` m^3^/s with flow patterns typical of high elevation watersheds on the west side of the northern Rocky Mountains which receive large amounts of precipitation as snow leading to peak levels of discharge during snowmelt, typically from May to July (Figures \@ref(fig:hydrology2-print) - \@ref(fig:hydrosummaryplot)).

<br>

Construction of the 183 m high and 2134 m long W.A.C. Bennett Dam was completed in 1967 at Hudson's Hope, BC, creating the Williston Reservoir [@hirst1991Impactsoperations]. Filling of the 375km^2^ reservoir was complete in 1972 and flooded a substantial portion of the Parsnip River and major tributary valleys forming what is now known as the Peace and Parsnip reaches. The replacement of riverine habitat with an inundated reservoir environment resulted in profound changes to the ecology, resource use and human settlement patterns in these systems [@hagen_etal2015Criticalhabitats; @pearce2019FirstNations; @stamford_etal2017FWCPArctic]. Prior to the filling of the reservoir, the Pack River, into which McLeod Lake flows, was a major tributary to the Parsnip River.  The Pack River currently enters the Williston Reservoir directly as the historic location of the confluence of the two rivers lies within the reservoir's footprint.

## Fisheries {-}
Fish species recorded in the Parsnip River watershed are detailed in Table \@ref(tab:table-fish) [@data_fish_obs]. In addition to flooding related to the formation of the Williston Reservoir, transmission lines, gas pipelines, rail, road networks, forestry, elevated water temperatures, interrupted connectivity, invasion from non-native species and insect infestations affecting forested areas pose threats to fisheries values in the Parsnip River watershed  [@hagen_2015_critical_habs; @stamfordFWCPArcticGrayling; @bull_trout_synthesis; @bt_cosewic]. A brief summary of trends and knowledge status related to Arctic grayling, bull trout, kokanee, mountain whitefish and rainbow Trout in Williston Watershed streams is provided in @fishandwildlifecompensationprogram2020PeaceRegion with a more detailed review of the state of knowledge for Parsnip River watershed populations of Arctic grayling and bull trout provided below.

```


### Bull Trout {-}

Bull Trout populations of the Williston Reservoir watershed are included within the Western Arctic population 'Designatable Unit 10', which, in 2012, received a ranking of ‘Special Concern’ by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada [@cosewic2012COSEWICassessment].  They were added to Schedule 1 under the Species of Risk Act in 2019  [@speciesregistrycanada2020BullTrout] and are also considered of special concern (blue-listed) provincially [@bcspeciesecosystemexplorer2020Salvelinusconfluentus]. Some or all of the long-term foot survey index sections of four Williston Reservoir spawning tributaries (Davis Creek, Misinchinka River, Point Creek, and Scott Creek), have been surveyed within 16 of the 19 years between 2001 and 2019 (16 of 19 in Davis River, 10 years over a 13-year period in the Misinchinka River, 11 years over a 14-year period for Point Creek, and 9 years over an 11-year period for Scott Creek [@hagen_etal2020CriticalSpawning]. 

<br>

A study of bull trout critical habitats in the Parsnip River was conducted in 2014 with the Misinchinka and Anzac systems identified as the most important systems for large bodied bull trout spawners accounting for a combined total of 65% of spawners counted.  The Table River was also highlighted as an important spawning destination accounting for an estimated 15% of the spawners.  Other watersheds identified as containing runs of large bodied bull troutspawners included the Colbourne, Reynolds, Hominka and Missinka River with potentially less than 50 spawners utilizing each sub-basin [@hagen_etal2015Criticalhabitats].  @hagen_weber2019Limitingfactors have synthesized a large body of information regarding limiting factors, enhancement potential, critical habitats and conservation status for bull trout of the Williston Reservoir and the reader is encouraged to review this work for context.  They have recommended experimental enhancements within a monitoring framework for Williston Reservoir bull trout (some spawning and rearing in Parsnip River mainstem and tributaries) which include stream fertilization, side channel development, riparian restoration and fish access improvement.  

<br>

In 2018, sub-basins of the Anzac River watershed, Homininka River, Missinka River and Table River watersheds were designated as fisheries sensitive watersheds under the authority of the *Forest and Range Practices Act* due to significant downstream fisheries values and significant watershed sensitivity [@anzac_sens; @hominka_sens; @table_sens; @missinka_sens]. Special management is required in these watersheds to protect habitat for fish species including bull trout and Arctic grayling including measures (among others) to limit equivalent clearcut area, reduce impacts to natural stream channel morphology, retain old growth attributes and maintain fish habitat/movement [@fsw_order].    

<br>

Tse'khene Elders from the McLeod Lake Indian Band report that sa'ba (Bull Trout) size and abundance has decreased in all rivers and tributaries from the reservoir with more injured and diseased fish captured in recent history than was common in the past [@pearceTSEKHENEFIRST2019]. 

<br>

### Arctic Grayling {-}
A detailed review of Arctic grayling life history can be referenced in @stamfordFWCPArcticGrayling. Since impoundment of the Williston Reservoir, it appears that physical habitat and ecological changes have been the most significant factors limiting Arctic grayling productivity. Although these changes are not well understood they have likely resulted in the inundation of key low gradient juvenile rearing and overwintering habitats, isolation of previously connected populations and increases in abundance of predators such as bull trout [@shrimptonj.m.GeneticAnalysisArctic2012; @hagenTrendAbundanceArctic2018].  

<br>

Migration of mature adult Arctic grayling occurs in the spring with arrival at known spawning locations coinciding with water temperatures of 4$^\circ$C.  Spawning in the Parsnip watershed appears to occur between late-May and late-June within sites located primarily within the lower reaches of the Anzac and Table rivers as well as within the Parsnip River mainstem. Side-channel and multiple-channel locations containing small gravels appear to be selected for spawning. Currently, the primary distribution of Williston Arctic grayling appears to be among fourth order and larger streams [@williamson_2004; @stamfordFWCPArcticGrayling]. @stewartFishLifeHistory2007 report that Arctic grayling spawn in large and small tributaries to rivers and lakes, intermittent streams, within mainstem rivers as well as lakes, most commonly at tributary mouths.   Although past study results indicate that 0+ grayling appeared to overwinter in lower reaches of larger tributaries (i.e. Table, Anzac rivers) as well as the Parsnip River and that few age-1+ grayling have been sampled in tributaries, habitat use in small tributaries and the extent they are connected with the mainstem habitats of all core areas is not well understood. Between 1995 and 2019, Arctic grayling population monitoring has been conducted in the Table River in nine out of 25 years (8 years for the Anzac) using snorkel surveys.  Results from 2018 are 2019 are intended to contribute to the assessment of the conservation status of the species in the Parsnip Core area [@hagenTrendAbundanceArctic2018].

<br>

Tse'khene Elders from the McLeod Lake Indian Band report that Arctic grayling numbers have declined dramatically since the flooding of the reservoir and that few dusk'ihje (Arctic Grayling) have been caught in the territory in the past 30 years [@pearceTSEKHENEFIRST2019].

### Environmental Stewardship Initiative

Working together with McLeod Lake Indian Band we are leveraging Regional Strategic Environmental Assessment Forum work [Environmental Stewardship Initiative](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/consulting-with-first-nations/collaborative-stewardship-bc/environmental-stewardship-initiative) by overlaying Parsnip River watershed group fish passage planning data with the [Recreational Opportunity Spectrum Inventory data](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/recreational-opportunity-spectrum-inventory) to facilitate discussions with partners and stakeholders about how long term landscape stewardship goals of McLeod Lake Indian Band relate to stream crossing infrastructure upgrades/removals within their traditional territory.  The inventory data summarizes recreation opportunities as combinations of settings and probable human experience opportunities organized along a spectrum of classes. The spectrum is set out in terms of seven classes as follows: Primitive (P), Semi-primitive Non-motorized (SPNM), Semi-primitive Motorized (SPM), Roaded Natural (RN), Roaded Modified (RM), Rural (R), Urban (U).  The general idea is that areas towards the primitive end of the spectrum provide more opportunities for First Nations groups such as the McLeod Lake Indian Band to exercise their rights as indigenous people wihtin natural areas within their traditional territory [@unitednationsgeneralassembly2007UnitedNations].


### Habitat Modelling

`bcfishpass` calculates the average gradient of BC Freshwater Atlas stream network lines at minimum 100m long intervals starting from the downstream end of the streamline segment and working upstream.  The network lines are broken into max gradient categories with new segments created if and when the average slope of the stream line segment exceeds user provided thresholds. For this project, the user provided gradient thresholds used to delineate "potentially accessible habitat" were based on estimated max gradients that salmon (15% - coho and chinook) and steelhead (20%) are likely to be capable of ascending.  

<br>


Through this initiative and other SERN/New Graph led initiatives, the Provincial Fish Passage Remediation Program and connectivity restoration planning [@mazany-wright_etal2021BulkleyRiver], `bcfishpass` has been designed to prioritize potential fish passage barriers for assessment or remediation. The software is under continual development and has been designed and constructed by @norris2021smnorrisbcfishpass using of sql and python based shell script libraries to generate a simple model of aquatic habitat connectivity.  The model identifes natural barriers (ex. steep gradients for extended distances) and hydroelectric dams to classifying the accessibility upstream by fish [@norris2021smnorrisbcfishpass]. On potentially accessible streams, scripts identify known barriers (ex. waterfalls >5m high) and additional anthropogenic features which are primarily road/railway stream crossings (i.e. culverts) that are potentially barriers. To prioritize these features for assessment or remediation, scripts report on how much modelled potentially accessible aquatic habitat the barriers may obstruct. The model can be refined with known fish observations upstream of identified barriers and for each crossing location, the area of lake and wetland habitat upstream, species documented upstream/downstream, an estimate of watershed area (on 2nd order and higher streams), mean annual precipitation weighted to upstream watershed area and channel width can be collated using `bcfishpass`, `fwapg` and `bcfishobs`.  This, information, can be used to provides an indication of the potential quantity and quality of habitat potentially gained should fish passage be restored by comparing to user defined thresholds for the aforementioned parameters. A discussion of the methodology to derive channel width is below.
 
 <br>

Gradient, channel size and stream discharge are key determinants of channel morphology and subsequently fish distribution. High value  rearing, overwintering  and spawning habitat preferred by numerous species/life stages of fish are often located within channel types that have relatively low gradients and large channel widths (also quantified by the amount of flow in the stream).  Following delineation of "potentially accessible habitat", the average gradient of each stream segment within habitat classified as below the 15% and 20% thresholds was calculated and summed within species and life stage specific gradient categories.  Average gradient of stream line segments can be calculated from elevations contained in the provincial freshwater atlas streamline dataset. To obtain estimates of channel width upstream of crossing locations, Where available, `bcfishpass` was utilized to pull average channel gradients from Fisheries Information Summary System (FISS) site assessment data [@moeStreamInventorySample] or PSCIS assessment data [@moe2021PSCISAssessments] and associate with stream segment lines. When both FISS and PSCIS values were associated with a particular stream segment, FISS channel width was used.  When multiple FISS sites were associated with a particular stream segment a mean of the average channel widths was taken.  To model channel width for 2nd order and above stream segments without associated FISS or PSCIS sites, first `fwapg` was used to estimate the drainage area upstream of the segment.  Then, rasters from ClimateBC [@wang_etal2012ClimateWNAHighResolution] were sampled for each stream segments and a mean annual precipitation weighted by upstream watershed area was calculated. Mean annual precipitation was then combined with the channel widths and BEC zone information (gathered through a spatial query tied to the bottom of the stream segment) into a dataset (n = 22990) for analysis fo the relationship between these variables.  The details of this analysis and resulting formula used to estimate channel width on stream segments in the Bukley River and Morice River watersheds is included as a technical appendix `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("[here](https://www.poissonconsulting.ca/f/859859031)")} else knitr::asis_output("at https://www.poissonconsulting.ca/f/859859031")`. 

<br>



`bcfishpass` and associated tools have been designed to be flexible in analysis, accepting user defined gradient, channel width and stream discharge categories [@moeStreamInventorySample].  Although currently in draft form, and subject to development revisions, gradient and channel width thresholds for habitat with the highest intrinsic value for a number of fish species in the Bulkley River and Morice River watersheds groups have been specified and applied to model habitat upstream of stream crossing locations with the highest intrinsic value (Table \@ref(tab:tab-fish-spawning-rearing)).  Thresholds were derived based on a literature review with references provided in Table \@ref(tab:tab-fish-spawning-rearing-references). Output parameters for modelling are presented in Table \@ref(tab:tab-bcfp-def).
